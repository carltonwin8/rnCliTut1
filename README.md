# React Native CLI First App

Created this application following:

- [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
- [Swipe Gestures with react-native-gesture-handler](https://www.reactnativeschool.com/swipe-gestures-with-react-native-gesture-handler)

After installing `node`, `watchman`, `xcode` and `react-native-cli`, this
project was create with the `react-native init rnCliTut1` command.

Use `react-native run-ios` to start the application.

For gestures use `npm i react-native-gesture-handler` then
`react-native link react-native-gesture-handler` for non-expo.
